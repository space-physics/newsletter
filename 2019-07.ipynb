    "## Introduction\n",
    "On the July 12th PyHC telecon, Aaron Roberts suggested we initiate a newsletter for PyHC, that could be distributed or linked via community mailing lists including CEDAR and AGU-SPA. \n",
    "We thought we'd start with a Jupyter Notebook, as a common feature of the PyHC Newsletter could be plots and examples from PyHC packages. \n",
    "This will help introduce a wide audience to PyHC packages, as well as motivate the PyHC authors to create and document interesting plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Package spotlight\n",
    "This month's spotlight includes a geomagnetic indices retriever and plotter, that covers a time span from 1930 to 2035 and computes smoothed indices for Ap, Kp and f10.7.\n",
    "These indices are distributed via various resources, and this package downloads, caches and presents the indices as \n",
